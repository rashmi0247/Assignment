I  don't have any idea where my heart is taking me towards. That emptiness and that feeling of being alone.
Interacting with peoples scares me these days. I dont know where i am heading but i know that it does not have a beautiful end. I am lost and the sad part is i dont even know how to bring myself back and how to shine.
The day you said you were leaving... that numbness in my heart.. there was a lot of things i had to say to you. Lot of things i had to confess.But at the last moment also, heart wwas so scared that i decided to let it be. I dedcided to keep my feelings with myself. I decided that i would rather cry in my dark room than confessing it and never talikng to you again.
Somehow, i built up the courage and made myself understand that I have to be strong and i should learn to let things go. I should learn that  somethings are just not meant to be and also you cant always get what you expect for and thats life.
I know not having you around is the fullstop for my feelings. Actually its a fullstop for everything. There will be no more stealing glances,, no more being happy just because you smiled at me  and no more eye contacts or anyting.
We are just some kinds of strangers now..But a bit different one who met,shared some special time together(tho it was onesided attention) and now apart.
I never know if i could see you again.... I am just so scared that my feelings for you will fade.. I am so scared that you will be just a simple person to me when we will meet next time . I am just so scared of losing things which i never owned.
